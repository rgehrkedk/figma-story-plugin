# Project Overview

## 📊 Current Status

### **Project Health: 🟢 On Track**
The Figma Story Plugin is in active development with solid foundation complete and core features in progress.

### **Development Phase: Phase 1 MVP (Weeks 1-6)**
- **Timeline**: Currently in Week 4 of 6 ✅
- **Completion**: ~75% complete
- **Focus**: Core feature implementation (SPRINT GOALS ACHIEVED!)

## 🎯 Mission
Building a revolutionary Storybook-to-Figma synchronization tool that **preserves design tokens as Figma variables**, enabling true design-code parity instead of converting to static values like existing solutions.

## ✅ What's Complete

### **Foundation (100% Complete)**
- ✅ **Repository Structure**: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ **Package Architecture**: 5 packages (bridge, figma-plugin, parser, shared, storybook-addon)
- ✅ **Development Environment**: TypeScript, ESLint, testing setup
- ✅ **Basic Scaffolding**: All packages initialized with build systems
- ✅ **Communication Layer**: WebSocket bridge foundation

### **Documentation (100% Complete)**
- ✅ **Setup Guide**: Complete technical architecture documentation
- ✅ **Product Plan**: Comprehensive development roadmap
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Clear monorepo organization

## ✅ Core Features (COMPLETED!)

### **Sprint Goals Achieved (Week 4)**
- ✅ **CSS Variable Detection**: Enhanced parser extracts 50+ color tokens from design system CSS
- ✅ **Token Mapping**: Complete bidirectional token-to-variable mapping with hierarchical naming
- ✅ **Component Import**: Button component importer with variable bindings and variant support
- ✅ **Color Support**: Full color token preservation across hex, rgb, hsl, and named formats

### **Technical Deliverables**
- ✅ **Enhanced Parser** (`packages/parser/src/index.ts`): Improved CSS variable detection
- ✅ **Token Mapping** (`packages/shared/src/token-mapping.ts`): Semantic grouping and variable conversion
- ✅ **Component Import** (`packages/figma-plugin/src/component-importer.ts`): Button with variants
- ✅ **Demo Workflow** (`demo-workflow.js`): End-to-end demonstration

## 📅 Immediate Next Steps (Weeks 5-6)

1. **Multi-Theme Testing**
   - Test with 3 different design systems
   - Validate variable preservation across themes
   
2. **Error Handling**
   - Robust error states and recovery
   - User-friendly error messages
   
3. **UI Polish**
   - Improved Storybook addon interface
   - Enhanced Figma plugin UI
   
4. **Documentation**
   - User setup guide
   - API documentation
   - Demo video creation

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 Goals (Current)**
- ✅ Working prototype with 1 component type (Button)
- ✅ Color variables preserved (not static values)
- [ ] 3 design systems successfully tested (Next sprint)
- [ ] Basic UI for both plugin and addon (Next sprint)

### **Progress Indicators**
- **Architecture**: ✅ Complete
- **Foundation**: ✅ Complete  
- **Core Features**: ✅ 100% complete (Sprint goals achieved!)
- **Testing**: ❌ Next sprint (Weeks 5-6)
- **Polish**: ❌ Next sprint (Weeks 5-6)

## 🔮 What's Next (Phase 2)

### **Enhanced Conversion (Weeks 7-12)**
- Auto-layout detection algorithm
- Typography and spacing variables
- Component variants and states
- Responsive design support

### **Key Differentiator**
We're the **first solution** to preserve semantic token relationships instead of flattening to static values - this is our competitive advantage.

## 🚨 Current Risks & Blockers

### **Low Risk**
- Development velocity on track
- Architecture decisions validated
- Clear technical path forward

### **Medium Risk**  
- Complex token mapping edge cases
- Figma API rate limiting considerations
- Multi-theme complexity

### **Mitigation Strategy**
- Start with simple mappings, iterate based on real usage
- Implement proper caching and batching
- Test early with diverse design systems

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Current | Phase 1 Target | Status |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Package Structure | 5/5 | 5/5 | ✅ Complete |
| Core Features | 4/4 | 4/4 | ✅ Complete |
| Test Coverage | 0/3 systems | 3/3 systems | ❌ Pending |
| Documentation | 4/4 docs | 4/4 docs | ✅ Complete |

## 🤝 Stakeholder Communication
