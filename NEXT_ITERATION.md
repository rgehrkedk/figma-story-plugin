  - [ ] Nested component support
  - [ ] Instance swapping capabilities

## üìä Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 Completion Criteria**
- [ ] **Technical**: Color variables work end-to-end
- [ ] **Quality**: Tested across 3 design systems  
- [ ] **User Experience**: Intuitive plugin interface
- [ ] **Documentation**: Setup guide and demo available
- [ ] **Performance**: Handles typical component library size

### **Phase 2 Entry Criteria**
- [ ] Phase 1 goals achieved
- [ ] Beta testing feedback incorporated
- [ ] Architecture validated for complex features
- [ ] Clear technical plan for layout detection

## üéØ Strategic Priorities

### **Competitive Advantage**
1. **Variable Preservation**: Only solution that maintains semantic tokens
2. **Multi-Theme Support**: Automatic mode generation in Figma
3. **Developer-First**: Git integration and CLI tools (future)
4. **Bidirectional Sync**: Design-to-code updates (Phase 3)

### **Market Positioning**
- **vs story.to.design**: Better variable support, lower cost
- **vs storybook-to-figma**: Production quality, advanced features  
- **vs Figma Dev Mode**: Better Storybook integration, automatic sync

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt & Improvements

### **Current Technical Debt**
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Improve TypeScript type coverage
- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket message handling

### **Architecture Improvements**

## üèÅ Success Definition

**This iteration is successful when:**
1. We have a working MVP that preserves color tokens as Figma variables
2. The solution works across multiple design systems
3. Users can successfully set up and use the plugin
4. We're ready to start Phase 2 enhanced features
5. Beta testers are excited about the unique value proposition

**The ultimate goal**: Become the standard tool for design system teams who want to preserve their design decisions rather than lose them to static values.
