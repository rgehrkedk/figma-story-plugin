# Storybook to Figma Variables - Product Development Plan

## Executive Summary

Building a next-generation Storybook-to-Figma synchronization tool that preserves design tokens as Figma variables, enabling true design-code parity. This product will be the first to maintain semantic token relationships rather than converting to static values.

**Unique Value Proposition**: "Don't just sync components - preserve your design decisions"

## Market Analysis

### Current Landscape

| Product | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| story.to.design | $149/month | Visual accuracy, auto-layout, pseudo-states | No variable support, one-way sync, expensive |
| storybook-to-figma (OSS) | Free | Open source, basic HTML conversion | Beta quality, no variable support, limited CSS |
| Figma Dev Mode | $35/month/seat | Official Figma solution | Requires manual setup, no Storybook integration |

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: 50,000+ companies using design systems
- **Pain Point**: 73% report design-code drift as major issue (2024 Design Systems Survey)
- **Willingness to Pay**: Teams currently paying $149/month for inferior solutions

## Product Vision

### Core Innovation: Variable-First Architecture

    C --> D[Figma Component]
    D --> E[Figma Variables]
    E --> F[Design Tokens]
    F --> A
```

### Key Differentiators

1. **Bidirectional Token Sync**
   - Code tokens → Figma variables (not static values)
   - Figma variable changes → Update code tokens

2. **Semantic Preservation**
   - `theme.color.primary` → `Brand/Primary` variable
   - Maintains relationships and inheritance

3. **Multi-Theme Intelligence**
   - Themes become Figma modes automatically
   - Switch brands without regenerating components

4. **Developer-First Approach**
   - CLI tool for CI/CD integration
   - Git-based version control for designs
   - Automated PR generation

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React (Storybook addon)
- **Figma Plugin**: TypeScript, Figma Plugin API
- **Parser**: PostCSS for CSS analysis, Babel for JS/TS AST
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time sync
- **Backend** (Phase 2): Node.js, PostgreSQL for team features

### Data Flow

1. **Token Extraction**
   ```typescript
   // Input: React component
   <Button style={{ color: theme.color.primary }}>
   
   // AST Analysis extracts:
   { 
     property: 'color',
     token: 'theme.color.primary',
     fallback: '#a8242f'
   }
   ```

2. **Variable Mapping**
   ```typescript
   // Token to Figma variable mapping
   {
     'theme.color.primary': 'VariableID:1:2',
     'theme.spacing.md': 'VariableID:1:3'
   }
   ```

3. **Component Generation**
   ```typescript
   // Figma component with variables
   {
     fills: [{ 
       type: 'SOLID',
       boundVariables: {
         color: { id: 'VariableID:1:2' }
       }
     }]
   }
   ```
