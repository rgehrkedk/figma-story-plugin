# Next Development Iteration - Core Implementation

## 🎯 Iteration Goal
Implement the core functionality to detect CSS variables in Storybook and create corresponding Figma variables, establishing the foundation for design token synchronization.

## 📋 Priority Tasks

### High Priority (Must Complete)
1. **CSS Variable Detection**
   - Implement CSS custom property parsing in the parser package
   - Extract color tokens from Storybook's CSS
   - Handle CSS variable inheritance and cascading

2. **Figma Variable Creation**
   - Integrate with Figma's Variables API
   - Create variable collections for design tokens
   - Map CSS color values to Figma variable formats

3. **WebSocket Communication**
   - Implement real-time messaging between Storybook addon and Figma plugin
   - Handle connection management and reconnection logic
   - Create message protocols for token synchronization

### Medium Priority (Should Complete)
4. **Basic Token Parsing**
   - Support for hex, rgb, hsl color formats
   - Token name normalization and validation
   - Basic error handling for malformed tokens

5. **Storybook Integration**
   - Auto-detect when stories are loaded/updated
   - Extract tokens from story CSS and components
   - Provide feedback UI for sync status

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
6. **Developer Experience**
   - Add logging and debugging capabilities
   - Improve error messages and validation
   - Basic documentation for package APIs

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Package Structure
```
packages/
├── parser/          → CSS variable extraction and parsing
├── bridge/          → WebSocket communication layer  
├── figma-plugin/    → Figma Variables API integration
├── storybook-addon/ → Storybook integration and UI
└── shared/          → Common types and utilities
```

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] CSS variable parser with color token support
- [ ] Figma plugin with variable creation capability
- [ ] WebSocket bridge for real-time communication
- [ ] Storybook addon with basic UI
- [ ] End-to-end demo: Storybook CSS variable → Figma variable

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for parser functions
- Integration tests for WebSocket communication
- Manual testing with simple Storybook setup
- Figma plugin testing in development mode

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Successfully parse at least 5 CSS color variables
- Create corresponding Figma variables in a test file
- Establish WebSocket connection between Storybook and Figma
- Complete end-to-end color token synchronization

## 🚧 Known Limitations
- Only color tokens in this iteration
- No theme/mode support yet
- Manual connection setup required
- Limited error handling

## 📝 Next Steps After This Iteration
1. Add support for typography and spacing tokens
2. Implement theme/mode synchronization
3. Add conflict resolution for token updates
4. Improve plugin UI and user experience
